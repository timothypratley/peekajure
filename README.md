# Peekajure

A Clojure library for summarizing large values.

## Rationale

Some values are too large to print at the REPL.

Common workarounds are to print just the keys of a map, or the count.

It might be nice to have the computer produce the most informative, yet still compact representation.

Inspectors exist, but don't solve the problem of concise summaries.

## Status

Pre-alpha - please tell me how to do this better.

TODO:

* recursive/nested
* indentation - preserve structure and pprint?
* better logic
* more examples
* extensibility (tmd datasets etc)

## Usage

...

## Contributing

Issues, suggestions and pull requests are welcome.

## Deploying
